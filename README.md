A small script for easily creating yes/no bash loops for use in scripts. You can

- Enter a qustion
- state what happens if yes or no
- sve the file to your working directory (automatic renaming if there are duplicates)
- save the file to a custom directory
- copy the loop to your clipboard (Wayland only)
